# DuckStation Texture Replacement Configuration
# This file allows you to set a per-game configuration for the dumping and
# replacement system, avoiding the need to use the normal per-game settings
# when moving files to a different computer. It also allows for the definition
# of texture aliases, for reducing duplicate files.
#
# All options are commented out by default. If an option is commented, the user's
# current setting will be used instead. If an option is defined in this file, it
# will always take precedence over the user's choice.

# Enables texture page dumping mode.
# Instead of tracking VRAM writes and attempting to identify the "real" size of
# textures, create sub-rectangles from pages based on how they are drawn. In
# most games, this will lead to significant duplication in dumps, and reduce
# replacement reliability. However, some games are incompatible with write
# tracking, and must use page mode.
#DumpTexturePages: false

# Dumps full texture pages instead of sub-rectangles.
# 256x256 pages will be dumped/replaced instead.
#DumpFullTexturePages: false

# Enables the dumping of direct textures (i.e. C16 format).
# Most games do not use direct textures, and when they do, it is usually for
# post-processing or FMVs. Ignoring C16 textures typically reduces garbage/false
# positive texture dumps, however, some games may require it.
#DumpC16Textures: false

# Reduces the size of palettes (i.e. CLUTs) to only those indices that are used.
# This can help reduce duplication and improve replacement reliability in games
# that use 8-bit textures, but do not reserve or use the full 1x256 region in
# video memory for storage of the palette. When replacing textures dumped with
# this option enabled, CPU usage on the GPU thread does increase trivially,
# however, generally it is worthwhile for the reliability improvement. Games
# that require this option include Metal Gear Solid.
#ReducePaletteRange: true

# Converts VRAM copies to VRAM writes, when a copy of performed into a previously
# tracked VRAM write. This is required for some games that construct animated
# textures by copying and replacing small portions of the texture with the parts
# that are animated. Generally this option will cause duplication when dumping,
# but it is required in some games, such as Final Fantasy VIII.
#ConvertCopiesToWrites: false

# Determines the maximum number of times a VRAM write/upload can be split, before
# it is discarded and no longer tracked. This is required for games that partially
# overwrite texture data, such as Gran Turismo.
#MaxVRAMWriteSplits: 0

# Determines the maximum size of an incoming VRAM write that will be merged with
# another write to the left/above of the incoming write. Needed for games that
# upload textures one line at a time. These games will log "tracking VRAM write
# of Nx1" repeatedly during loading. If the upload size is 1, then you can set
# the corresponding maximum coalesce dimension to 1 to merge these uploads,
# which should enable these textures to be dumped/replaced.
#MaxVRAMWriteCoalesceWidth: 0
#MaxVRAMWriteCoalesceHeight: 0

# Determines the minimum size of a texture that will be dumped. Textures with a
# width/height smaller than this value will be ignored.
#DumpTextureWidthThreshold: 16
#DumpTextureHeightThreshold: 16

# Determines the minimum size of a VRAM write that will be dumped, in background
# dumping mode. Uploads smaller than this size will be ignored.
#DumpVRAMWriteWidthThreshold: 128
#DumpVRAMWriteHeightThreshold: 128

# Enables the use of a bilinear filter when scaling replacement textures.
# If more than one replacement texture in a 256x256 texture page has a different
# scaling over the native resolution, or the texture page is not covered, a
# bilinear filter will be used to resize/stretch the replacement texture, and/or
# the original native data.
#ReplacementScaleLinearFilter: false

# Use this section to define replacement aliases. One line per replacement
# texture, with the key set to the source ID, and the value set to the filename
# which should be loaded as a replacement. For example, without the newline,
# or keep the multi-line separator.
#Aliases:
  # Alias-Texture-Name: Path-To-Texture
